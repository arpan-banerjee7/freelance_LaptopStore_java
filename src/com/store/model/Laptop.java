/*
This Project focuses on method, array and object class.
Design and develop a Java program that can store, edit, search and display the information of Laptops.

The data of Laptop to store include the brand, the model, the manufacturer year, and the price.
The search function allows the user to search by brand, model, price range and manufacturer year. 
The search result shows the number of matching laptops and the list of the laptops with the information.
The system also allows to user to set the same discount rate for all the laptops and displays the discounted price for the laptops in the search result.

Requirements of class design You need to create a 
class for the Laptop object with appropriate attributes (including discount rate), constructors, getters and setter, toString method, 
and a method that can return the discount price of a laptop. The class can keep track of the number of objects and it has a method that returns the data. 
Apply appropriate access modifiers to the members of the class. In your client/driver program, you need to create an array of Laptop 
that can store at least 30 laptops. Initial the array with 10 laptop objects.
